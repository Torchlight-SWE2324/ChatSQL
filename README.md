ChatSQL is a simple chat application that lavarages on LLM models to generate a SQL query from a natural language query, given a database schema.

This application was developed as part of a project for the [SC01103936: Software Engineering](https://en.didattica.unipd.it/off/2021/LT/SC/SC1167/000ZZ/SC01103936) course at the University of Padua and was proposed by _Zucchetti S.p.A._ .

## Proposal

The proposal of the project can be found [here](https://www.math.unipd.it/~tullio/IS-1/2023/Progetto/C9.pdf) (in Italian).

The idea is to develop a chat application that allows the user to ask questions about a database schema in natural language and receive the corresponding SQL query.
